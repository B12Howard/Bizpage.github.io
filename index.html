                                    The client, an entrepreneur in the B2B social media industry, wanted to move away from their proof of concept Google Sheet to a standalone web application.

                                    My main task was to bring the entire project from concept to production. I had to understand the client's specific requirements, gather relevant information, and collaborate with the team to develop a comprehensive solution. Additionally, I was responsible for ensuring the system was user-friendly and on budget.
                                    </p>

                                    To begin, I worked with the client, design team, and marketing to create a timeline and feature sets
                                    <br />
                                    During the development phase, I found hosting, coded the frontend and backend, and modeled the database.
                                    <br />
                                    I was the main person to design the system's architecture, selecting appropriate technologies, and coding the components. I regularly communicated with the client, providing progress updates, seeking feedback, and addressing any concerns promptly. Additionally, I conducted thorough testing to identify and resolve any issues before the final delivery.
                                    </p>

                                    <br />
                                    As a result of our efforts, we successfully delivered the custom application to the client within three months. It doubled the amount of paying customers in several months after launch.

                                    <br />
                                    The client, a home remodeling company based in Long Island, New York, wanted a comprehensive business solution based on Google Workspace.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Task:
                                    <br />
                                    My responsibility was to design and develop the Google Workspace-based business solution tailored to the needs of the home remodeling company. I had to understand their specific requirements, analyze their existing processes, and create a solution that would automate and optimize their workflow. The key features included a custom CRM system, automated client messaging, project management tools, and a semi-automated quote creation feature to reduce quote turnaround time.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Action:
                                    <br />
                                    To start, I conducted in-depth meetings with the home remodeling company's stakeholders to gather their requirements and gain a thorough understanding of their business processes. Based on their input, I designed and developed a custom CRM system in Google Sheets.
                                    <br />
                                    Next, to address the time-consuming quote creation process, I developed a semi-automated quote generation feature. By storing the labor and materials data using Google Sheets as a database, the system was able to generate accurate quotes within hours, significantly reducing the time it took from days to hours.
                                    <br />
                                    I implemented automated client messaging functionality, leveraging Twilio's API and Gmail's API. This enabled the company to automatically send updates, project milestones, and appointment reminders to clients, ensuring effective and timely communication throughout the remodeling process.
                                    <br />
                                    For project management, I created a template in Google Sheets that was automatically created for every project, allowing clients to view progress and keep track of payments. This provided transparency to their clients resulting greater client satisfaction with their remodeling project.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Result:
                                    As a result of our efforts, the home remodeling company experienced a significant improvement in their operations and efficiency. The custom CRM system provided them with a consolidated view of client information, enabling better customer relationship management. The automated client messaging feature enhanced communication, leading to improved client satisfaction and reduced manual effort.
                                    <br />
                                    The semi-automated quote creation feature resulted in a substantial reduction in quote turnaround time, allowing the company to respond to client inquiries promptly and secure more projects. And freeing up sales people to talk to more people and less time in front of the computer building quotes.
                                    <br />
                                    The implementation of the Google Workspace-based business solution led to increased productivity, improved customer service, and ultimately, a boost in revenue for the home remodeling company.

                                    Situation:
                                    The client, a bachelor party planning business based in Quebec, required a web application built using Google Apps Script. The goal was to develop a robust platform that could load customer sheets, which included a custom quoting system, an itinerary builder, and a custom CRM to manage all the sheets effectively to replace their manual workflow.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Task:
                                    My task was to design and develop the web application using Google Apps Script to meet the specific needs of the bachelor party planning business. The key functionalities to be implemented were loading client sheets, integrating a custom quoting system, developing an itinerary builder, and creating a custom CRM using Google Sheets.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Action:
                                    To begin, I created the custom quoting system. This enabled them to more quickly generate quotes for their clients based on their business requirements. The quoting system automatically calculated costs and allowed the user to send the quote to the customer from the app.
                                    <br />
                                    Next, I implemented an itinerary builder within the web application. This feature allowed the client to create detailed itineraries for each bachelor party, including activities, locations, and timings. The itinerary builder provided a user-friendly interface for the client to easily customize and update the itinerary as needed.
                                    <br />
                                    To effectively manage all the client sheets, I developed a custom CRM system using Google Sheets. This allowed the client to store and track all their client data, including contact information, preferences, quotes, and itineraries. The CRM system provided an organized and centralized platform for efficient client management.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Result:
                                    The web application built using Google Apps Script transformed the bachelor party planning business's operations. It streamlined their workflow, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency. The integrated custom quoting system allowed for accurate and quick quote generation, enhancing client satisfaction and enabling faster decision-making.
                                    <br />
                                    The itinerary builder feature provided a user-friendly interface for creating and managing detailed itineraries, saving time and improving organization. The custom CRM built in Google Sheets enabled the business to effectively track and manage all client data, improving customer relationship management and enhancing overall productivity.

                                    Situation:
                                    The client, a finance startup, required a custom Google Sheets add-on that could communicate with their API. The objective was to develop a tool that would enable users to build formulas using custom functions, allowing each cell in Google Sheets to interact with the API and retrieve financial data.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Task:
                                    My responsibility was to design and develop the Google Sheets add-on that would integrate with the client's API. The key task was figuring out how to build a formula that would communicate with the API and make it pleasant for the user to use.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Action:
                                    To begin, I collaborated closely with the finance startup's team to understand their API structure, authentication mechanisms, and the specific financial data they wanted to expose through the Google Sheets add-on. Based on this information, I designed the add-on.
                                    <br />
                                    Next, I developed the necessary code using Google Apps Script to establish a connection between Google Sheets and the client's API. I implemented custom functions that users could embed within formulas, enabling dynamic interaction with the API to retrieve real-time financial data. The add-on also included authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access and data integrity.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Result:
                                    Their users were able to leverage the power of Google Sheets to work with the startup's financial data, being able to retrieve data directly within their Google Sheets spreadsheets. This eliminated the need for manual data entry and reduced the risk of errors, enhancing data accuracy and efficiency.
                                    <br />
                                        The add-on's integration with the client's API allowed users to access a wide range of financial data points, empowering their users to more quickly create models and perform complex calculations within Google Sheets.</p>
